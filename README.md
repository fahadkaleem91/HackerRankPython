## About this repository

This is my attempt to solve all practice problems, using the Python language. The target is to solve as many as I can, and learn Python to program in Python. Today is Day 2 of my Python Learning and I hope I get to learn an lot in this process

### Contents:

The name of the practice problem will be the same as the one used in Hacker Rank. If anyone feels that there is a better solution for any of the problems I provided, please email me at fahadkaleem91@hotmail.com. Like I said earlier, I'm still new to programming and I believe we all can teach each other
